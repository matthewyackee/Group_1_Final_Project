Members:  Cole Geiger, Yuriy Komissarov, Matthew Yackee, Krishnendu Aneesh

## Objective:
To understand the dynamics of stock performance across different market cycles and technological eras by comparing historical and current market leaders across various sectors.


## Steps:

Data Collection: 
Retrieve historical stock data, financial statements, and market indicators for each company from financial databases through Spark.

Data Preparation:
Clean and standardize the data to prepare for modeling. This involves handling missing values, adjusting for stock splits and dividends, and standardizing financial indicators.

Model Implementation:
Develop models to predict future stock prices or classify stock movement trends (up/down) using historical data. Implement models like Linear Regression for price prediction and Logistic Regression for movement classification.
Ensure models meet the criteria of at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared for predictive power.

Model Optimization:
Show iterative changes and their impacts on model performance. This could involve hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or trying different modeling techniques.

Evaluation:
Evaluate the models based on performance metrics and compare the predictive power and accuracy between the stocks of the new and old generations.


## Next Steps and Team Assignments:

Data Collection and Preparation:
Retrieving and initially cleaning the data, followed by its normalization and standardization

Model Implementation:
Model implementation, training, and initial optimization, as well as guiding the testing and refinement process, including parameter adjustments.

Evaluation:
The final evaluation of model performance, offering insights and suggestions for improvements.
