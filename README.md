Members:  Cole Geiger, Yuriy Komissarov, Matthew Yackee, Krishnendu Aneesh

## Objective:

To understand the dynamics of stock performance by examining how market leaders have navigated different market cycles and technological changes over time. To accomplish this, we'll compare the performance of historical market leaders with today's top companies across various sectors. This comparison will shed light on how shifts in the economy and advancements in technology influence financial success and market positioning. Ultimately, our analysis seeks to uncover patterns and strategies that promote long-term stability and growth in the ever-changing global market landscape.


## Steps:

Data Collection: Retrieve historical stock data, financial statements, and market indicators for each company from financial databases through SQL. This involves querying databases to extract relevant information such as stock prices, trading volumes, financial ratios, and economic indicators.

Data Preparation: Clean and standardize the data to prepare for modeling. This involves handling missing values, adjusting for stock splits and dividends, and standardizing financial indicators. Additionally, the data may need to be transformed or normalized to ensure consistency and accuracy across different features.

Model Implementation: Develop models to predict future stock prices or classify stock movement trends (up/down) using historical data. Implement XGB Boost to predict outcomes based on historical data. Ensure models meet the criteria of at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared for predictive power.

Model Optimization: Show iterative changes and their impacts on model performance. This could involve hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or trying different modeling techniques such as ensemble methods or neural networks.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model using R-squared based on performance metrics and compare the predictive power and accuracy between various stocks.
